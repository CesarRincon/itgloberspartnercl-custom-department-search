# Department Search

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-0-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

The custom-department-search component is a department filtering component, it allows you to do custom searches by store departments and thus find the product a little more precisely.

## Configuration 

1. Import the Department Search's app to your theme's dependencies in the manifest.json, for example:
```json
  dependencies: {
    "{vendor}.custom-department-search": "0.x"
  }
 ```
 
 2. Add the department search block to the store-theme. For example:
```json
 "flex-layout.col#search_by_department": {
    "title": "Search by department",
    "children": [
        "rich-text#title__search-by-department",
        "department-search"
        ]
  },
   ```

   Block name      | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `department-search` | ![https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red)  Top level block that must be declared in the `store-theme` block to render department search   |
